# To run

For any example, just go to /src on our XINOID device, run make and run the generated executable. If you want to create your own application outside the device, you can import it into our device through the update script.

# Dependencies and usage


It is completely necessary to have a reader XINOID to be able to run the examples. Some examples need an external library that must be downloaded. 
For this, some examples include a readme where the libraries are included.
